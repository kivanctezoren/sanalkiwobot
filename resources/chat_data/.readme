This directory holds specific lists of chat IDs.
The list "admin_chats" is only read and not modified in the program.
The lists "annc_blist" and "chats" are expected to end with empty lines so that they can be written to properly (see the db_add function).
The comments and warnings regarding each database can be found in the code where they are first imported.

Note that if the database files are altered manually while the bot is running, the changes won't be reflected in the program until it is restarted. If a manual change must be made, the bot should be stopped and must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
