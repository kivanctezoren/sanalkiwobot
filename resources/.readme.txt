This directory holds various data to be accessed later by the bot. The comments and warnings regarding each file can be found in the code where they are first imported.

Note that if the database files are altered manually while the bot is running, the changes won't be reflected in the program until it is restarted. If a manual change must be made, the bot should be stopped and must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
