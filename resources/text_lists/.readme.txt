This folder holds string lists to be used as a database for word recognition and specific replies. The comments and warnings regarding each database can be found in the code where they are first imported.

The lines matching the ones specified in db_read definition will be skipped. "#%#" is chosen as a comment indicator.
For dictionaries, the lines will be processed in pairs: first the key, then the corresponding value, and then the next key, and so on.
